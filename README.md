<h1> Project: Web App - Weather Forecast API </h1>

This web application, built using Streamlit, provides real-time weather forecasts via API services. 

Streamlit handles the creation of user-friendly widgets and visualization of forecast data, 
while an API service fetches the weather data from the backend

    ```
* Install dependencies: 
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

<h3> Usage </h3>
 
**A. Run the Web App Locally;**

   - This option is ideal for users familiar with Python programs and the Streamlit framework.
      ```
      streamlit run main.py
      ```
OR,

**B. Host the Web App Online (Optional);**

   - For users familiar with Streamlit servers:
     1. You can deploy the program on a Streamlit server and,
     2. Generate a public website URL.

   Refer to the Streamlit documentation for deployment instructions: https://share.streamlit.io/

<h3> Screenshots </h3>
    
- Fyi only, a snippet of weather API call documentation page:

   ![weather forecast webapp](/app_screenprint/plotting_sky.png?raw=true)

<h3> Features </h3>

1. **City Input & Forecast Length Slider**: Allow users to input a city name and select the forecast length (e.g., 3 days, 5 days) using a slider.
2. **Temperature Trends**: Display temperature trends over the selected forecast period using a line graph.
3. **Sky Conditions Visualization**: Show sky conditions (clear, clouds, rain, snow) using relevant images based on the forecast data‚Å¥.

And, other potential use-cases that can expand as;

- **Server Deployment & Public URL:** Host your app on a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS) and provide a public URL for easy access by users.
- **Integration with Existing Platforms:** Collaborate with other platforms (e.g., weather websites, blogs) to embed your weather widget as supplemental information on their pages.
- **Premium User:** We can also create a subscription/revenue based model to monetize this webapp - with data privacy and security of any payment system.
